GREP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    GREP(1)



NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - search a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [ option ] ...  expression [ file ] ...

       egrep [ option ] ...  [ expression ] [ file ] ...

       fgrep [ option ] ...  [ strings ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Commands  of the grep family search the input files (standard input de-
       fault) for lines matching a pattern.   Normally,  each  line  found  is
       copied  to  the standard output.  Grep patterns are limited regular ex-
       pressions in the style of ed(1); it uses a compact nondeterministic al-
       gorithm.   Egrep  patterns are full regular expressions; it uses a fast
       deterministic algorithm that sometimes needs exponential space.   Fgrep
       patterns  are fixed strings; it is fast and compact.  The following op-
       tions are recognized.

       -v     All lines but those matching are printed.

       -x     (Exact) only lines matched in their entirety are printed  (fgrep
              only).

       -c     Only a count of matching lines is printed.

       -l     The  names  of files with matching lines are listed (once) sepa-
              rated by newlines.

       -n     Each line is preceded by its relative line number in the file.

       -b     Each line is preceded by the block number on which it was found.
              This  is sometimes useful in locating disk block numbers by con-
              text.

       -e expression
              Same as a simple expression argument, but useful  when  the  ex-
              pression begins with a -.

       -f file
              The  regular  expression (egrep) or string list (fgrep) is taken
              from the file.

       In all cases the file name is shown if there is  more  than  one  input
       file.  Care should be taken when using the characters $ * [ ^ | ( ) and
       \ in the expression as they are also meaningful to the  Shell.   It  is
       safest to enclose the entire expression argument in single quotes ' '.

       Fgrep  searches  for  lines that contain one of the (newline-separated)
       strings.

       Egrep accepts extended regular expressions.  In the following  descrip-
       tion `character' excludes newline:

              A  \  followed  by a single character other than newline matches
              that character.

              The character ^ ($) matches the beginning (end) of a line.

              A .  matches any character.

              A single character not otherwise endowed  with  special  meaning
              matches that character.

              A  string  enclosed  in brackets [] matches any single character
              from the string.  Ranges of ASCII character codes may be  abbre-
              viated  as in `a-z0-9'.  A ] may occur only as the first charac-
              ter of the string.  A literal - must be placed where it can't be
              mistaken as a range indicator.

              A  regular expression followed by * (+, ?) matches a sequence of
              0 or more (1 or more, 0 or 1) matches of the regular expression.

              Two regular expressions concatenated match a match of the  first
              followed by a match of the second.

              Two regular expressions separated by | or newline match either a
              match for the first or a match for the second.

              A regular expression enclosed in parentheses matches a match for
              the regular expression.

       The  order  of precedence of operators at the same parenthesis level is
       [] then *+? then concatenation then | and newline.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2 for syntax  er-
       rors or inaccessible files.

BUGS
       Ideally there should be only one grep, but we don't know a single algo-
       rithm that spans a wide enough range of space-time tradeoffs.

       Lines are limited to 256 characters; longer lines are truncated.
