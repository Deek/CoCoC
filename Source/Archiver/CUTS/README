This is the 1.6 release of the CUTS source code.

This file contains a brief history of the program, and instructions
for compiling CUTS on the various systems which are currently
supported.

The CUTS format was designed by me at the request of Eric Tilenius to
provide a method for transferring CoCo and OS9 binaries over
electronic mail.  As far as our testing can show, CUTS-encoded files
are resistant to character losses due to: ASCII <-> EBCDIC conversion
(which can trash uuencoded files) and mailers which strip
leading/trailing spaces or barf on lines longer than 80 characters.

Any changes, fixes, or alterations to this source should be forwarded
to me via Email at one of the following addresses:

Internet: koonce@math.berkeley.edu
Bitnet:   koonce@UCBBRAHMS
UUCP:    ...!ucbvax!math!koonce
Delphi:  TIMKOONCE
CompuServe: 72276,1135

In particular, I would like to know about any changes needed to
port CUTS to other systems.

--------------- Compilation Instructions -----------------------------

** OS9 
   (Compilation under OS9/6809 requires the Kreider C libraries.)  If
you have 'make', then compile with 'make -f makefile_os9'.  Otherwise,
you can use the following command line:

cc  -dOS9 -f=cuts cuts.c cuts_decode.c cuts_encode.c cuts_getopt.c

** Unix 
     Use the command line 'make -f makefile_unix'

** VMS 
     Read instructions in file 'makefile_vms.com'.

** IBM PC/Turbo C 
     Copy all CUTS files into one directory, and compile with the
following command line:

tcc -DIBMPC *.c C:\TC\LIB\wildargs.obj

The last item on the command line is the full pathname of the
wildargs.obj file supplied with Turbo C.  It may be different for your
system.  It provides command-line wildcard expansion.  If you do not
have this file, or do not wish wildcard expansion, you can compile
with the command line:

tcc -DIBMPC *.c
