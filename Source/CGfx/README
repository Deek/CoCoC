CGFX 7 release notes - 10/9/90
------------------------------

This archive contains the following files:

  release.notes - this file...
  cgfx.l        - the CGFX library (version 7)
  malloc.r      - replacement malloc() and free() functions
  *.h           - header files.

Some versions of the Kreider library have a buggy malloc() (among other 
things.)  My version of the malloc() and free() functions (in malloc.r)
are based off of those presented in K&R 2nd edition.  To use the new malloc,
type the following:

 merge malloc.r >+cgfx.l
 
(this assumes you are using Shell+)

Most functions have lost weight (in particular, the Dialog() function has
lost about 800 bytes!), primarily due to minor recoding and register
variables.
