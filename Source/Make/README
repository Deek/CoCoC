This is the source for the Make utility.  Please tell me if you come
up with any improvements to it.

Delphi: TIMKOONCE, TIMKIENTZLE
Internet: koonce@math.berkeley.edu
Bitnet: koonce@UCBBRAHMS

Installing Make:
 - "make.default" should be in the "/dd/sys" directory with r, pr attr
 - "make" should be in your current exec dir with the appropriate attr

Customizing Make:
 - The major way you can customize make is to edit /dd/sys/make.default
   to change the default rules to fit your own particular setup.
   I am especially interested in knowing good default rules for use with
   other languages (i.e. Pascal, ASM, RMA, etc.)
 - If you want to re-compile, there are a couple of easy customizations
   you can make to the source:
     - The filename for "/dd/sys/make.default" is defined in h.h.
       You can change it to your preference.
     - By undefining DEFN0, make will use compiled-in rules, defined
       in rules.c.  This will help make start up faster.

Among other changes I've made:
 - I fixed the -q and -p options
 - I added support for -f, -z, and -u
 - I generalized the implicit command checking to allow for targets with
   no suffix, i.e.  .r:; <command>  defines a command to build a target
   with no suffix from a .r file.
 - I added recognition of the semicolon separator to include commands
   on the same line
 - I added support for ODIR and RDIR (see make.default for more info)
 - If there is no makefile, make will build a null entry for a target
   on the command line, and try to apply it's rules from there.

Differences from Tandy Make:
- SDIR is not supported.
- The default rules are probably different.
- This make doesn't have the annoying bug of making intermediate
  files many times if they occur in more than one branch of the
  dependency tree.  (Yea!)
- To determine a timestamp for a file with no suffix, this make will
  first look in the current exec dir, then the current data dir.

Differences from Unix Make:
- The -k option is not supported.
- The ~ modifier is not supported.

General comments.
   I took this up largely to get a make which didn't have the most
annoying bugs of Tandy make, and which supported implicit dependency
checking.  Many of the features (such as double-colon targets and
.PRECIOUS targets) have not been fully tested.  The current version
works well for me.  I would like to see -k implemented, and more
reasonable output from -d.
