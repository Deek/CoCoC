Using OS9-type line endings::

This repository is intended to be useful when overlaid right on top of an
OS9-type filesystem. If you are using it on a Unix-style system (or a Windows 
system with the "tr" utility), you can add the contents of the file "gitsetup"
in the root of this repository to your checkout's ".git/config" file. If you
delete all files in the checkout (that is, all the files _not_ in the .git/
directory) and call "git checkout" again to get them all back, then all of the
text files (mostly source code) will be checked out with CR-only line endings
instead of LF for Unix-type systems or CRLF for DOS/Windows-type systems. At
this point, you should be able to copy the files over to an OS9 filesystem
without causing trouble for it.
