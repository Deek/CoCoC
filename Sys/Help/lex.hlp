LEX(1)                      General Commands Manual                     LEX(1)



NAME
       lex - generator of lexical analysis programs

SYNOPSIS
       lex [ -tvfn ] [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Lex  generates  programs  to be used in simple lexical analyis of text.
       The input files (standard input default) contain regular expressions to
       be  searched  for, and actions written in C to be executed when expres-
       sions are found.

       A C source program, `lex.yy.c' is generated, to be compiled thus:

              cc lex.yy.c -ll

       This program, when run, copies unrecognized portions of  the  input  to
       the  output,  and executes the associated C action for each regular ex-
       pression that is recognized.

       The following lex program converts upper case to lower, removes  blanks
       at the end of lines, and replaces multiple blanks by single blanks.


              %%
              [A-Z] putchar(yytext[0]+'a'-'A');
              [ ]+$
              [ ]+  putchar(' ');

       The options have the following meanings.

       -t     Place  the  result  on  the  standard  output instead of in file
              `lex.yy.c'.

       -v     Print a one-line summary of statistics  of  the  generated  ana-
              lyzer.

       -n     Opposite of -v; -n is default.

       -f     `Faster' compilation: don't bother to pack the resulting tables;
              limited to small programs.
